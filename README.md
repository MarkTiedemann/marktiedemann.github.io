**Mark** 

was skeptical about Node.js at first - that is, until he realized its full potential. Now, he’s all in, and excited to help it take over the world -- one callback at a time!

Mark also specializes in teaching why Scrum, Kanban and most things considered methodology are, at best, as silver bullet as a rusty shrapnell. Yet, he got infected with the agile and lean ~~mindset~~ virus and has been an addict ever since.

Having said that, he is universally enthusiastic about making work fun and meaningful. Most importantly, though, Mark is passionate about helping and sharing. Or put another way, he wants to make the world a better place. :)
