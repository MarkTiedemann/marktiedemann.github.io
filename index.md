I'm a software engineer that tries to be a decent, open-minded person.

<span style="color: #ff5e6e;">**Welcome to my _web.site_!**</span> (It is currently under construction so don't expect too much.)

_(Quick tip: If you prefer <span id="brightness">bright</span> sites, you can click the <span id="icon">sun</span> in the top right corner to switch to the <span id="theme">light</span> theme.)_

If you are looking for my code, you can find all of the open-source bits and bytes on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann).

#### # Looking for my CV?

More details coming soon... But here's a short preview: I recently worked on the agency software-as-a-service [HQ](https://hellohq.io) and its reimagined companion [Q.](https://meetq.ai) at [HQLabs](https://hqlabs.com/).

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I studied Business Informatics at [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html) (but I preferred the informatics part).

#### # Want to work with me?

TL;DR - If you want to work with me, please be aware that I _dislike_ open-plan offices, working early in the morning, and JIRA.

I'm a bit introverted so I prefer a quiet working environment with a small team. I do, however, love to pair-program from time to time! (Doing it every day would probably exhaust me, though.) I'm open to remote work, but haven't tried it yet.

I'm a [night owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_%28person%29). This means I work best in the afternoon, evening, sometimes late at night, but absolutely _not_ in the morning hours. After having a good night's sleep, I usually start my work around noon.

I'm pretty comfortable in both front- and backend, and I dabble in (dev) ops from time to time. I think _no code_ `>` correct code `>` simple, maintainable code `>` performant code, but I'm willing to throw exceptions for good reasons on a case by case basis.

I usually document and test my code appropriately, even if it takes a little longer (hint: in most cases, _it doesn't_). If I didn't, I probably got distracted learning something new, drifting off into the depths of the internet or the terminal for a few hours... and hopefully, came back as a better programmer.

Being both an imperfect perfectionist and/or a minimalist, I enjoy refactoring and code reviews quite a bit. Plus, I hate typos.

I also like to share knowledge! Of all sorts, from technical tutorials for my co-workers (e.g. _[Docker step by step: A hands-on Docker tutorial](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann/docker-step-by-step)_), to programming trainings, to _"How does the internet even work?"_-workshops for everyone.

#### # Any questions? Wanna say hello?

I am a bit shy, but you can send me an [email](mailto:www.marktiedemann@gmail.com), or just DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkTiedemannDE).

#### # Found a typo or, _worse_, a bug?

Please let me know! The [source code](https://github.com/marktiedemann/marktiedemann.github.io) of this site is available on GitHub. Issues, PRs and feedback of any kind are welcome!

Hope you enjoyed the read.
