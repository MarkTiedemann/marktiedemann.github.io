**Welcome to my _web.site_!**

_(Quick tip: If you prefer bright, welcoming websites, you can click the sun in the top right corner to switch to the light theme.)_

If you are looking for my code, you can find all of the open-source bits and bytes on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann).

#### # Looking for my CV?

Coming soon... But here's a short preview: I recently worked on the agency software-as-a-service [HQ](https://hellohq.io) and its reimagined companion [Q.](https://meetq.ai) at [HQLabs](https://hqlabs.com/).

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I studied Business Informatics at [HAW Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html) (as it turned out, I vastly preferred the computer science part over the business one...).

#### # Want to work with me?

TL;DR - If you want to work with me, please be aware that I _dislike_ open-plan offices, working early in the morning, and JIRA.

I'm a bit introvert so I prefer a quiet working environment with a small team. I do, however, love to pair-program from time to time! (Doing it every day would probably exhaust me, though.) I'm open to remote work, but haven't tried it yet.

I'm a [night owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_%28person%29). This means I work best in the afternoon, evening, sometimes late at night, but absolutely _not_ in the morning hours. After having a good night's sleep, I usually start my work around noon.

#### # A bit more about me

I'm pretty comfortable in both front- and backend, and I dabble in (dev) ops from time to time. I think _no code_ `>` correct code `>` simple, maintainable code `>` performant code, but I'm willing to throw exceptions for good reasons on a case by case basis.

I usually document and test my code appropriately, even if it takes a little longer (hint: in most cases, _it doesn't_). And if I didn't, I probably had a bluescreen or, worse, got distracted learning something new, drifting off into the depths of the internet or the command line for a few hours...

Being both an imperfect perfectionist and/or a minimalist, I probably enjoy refactoring and code reviews more than the average person. Plus, I hate typos.

#### # Any questions? Wanna say hello?

I am a bit shy, but you can send me an [email](mailto:www.marktiedemann@gmail.com), or just DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkTiedemannDE).

#### # Found a typo or, _worse_, a bug?

Please let me know! The [source code](https://github.com/marktiedemann/marktiedemann.github.io) of this site is available on GitHub, too. Issues, feedback, and PRs are welcome!
