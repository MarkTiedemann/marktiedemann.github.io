I'm a software engineer that tries to be a decent, open-minded person.

<span id="welcome" class="darkred">**Welcome to my _web.site_!**</span>

If you are looking for my code, you can find all of the open-source bits and pieces on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann).

Recently, I joined [E.ON](https://eon.com) as a senior dev/ops engineer. Previously, I worked on the agency software-as-a-service [HQ](https://hellohq.io) and its reimagined companion [Q.](https://meetq.ai) at [HQLabs](https://hqlabs.com).

#### # Want to work with me?

I'm a bit introverted. In line with this, I prefer a quiet working environment with a small team.

Also, I'm a [night owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_owl_%28person%29). This means I feel most energetic and productive in the evening or at night, outside of regular business hours. After having a good night's sleep, I usually start working close to noon.

I'm pretty comfortable in both front- and backend, and I dabble in (dev) ops from time to time. I think _no code_ `>` correct code `>` simple, maintainable code `>` performant code, but I'm willing to throw exceptions for good reasons on a case by case basis. I usually document and test my code appropriately, even if it takes a little longer (in most cases, it's well worth the effort).

I enjoy learning new things. So when I do, I easily drift off into the depths of the internet, the terminal, a game, or a book for a few hours - without noticing time fly by.

Hand in hand with this, I also like to share knowledge of all sorts! From technical tutorials for my co-workers (for example, _[Docker: Step by Step](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann/docker-step-by-step)_), to programming trainings, to _"How does the internet even work?"_-workshops for everyone.

At times, I'm an imperfect perfectionist and/or a minimalist so I probably enjoy refactoring and code reviews more than the average person. Plus, I hate typos.
