**Welcome to my _web.site_!**

If you are looking for my code, you can find all of the open-source bits and bytes on [GitHub](https://github.com/MarkTiedemann).

#### # Looking for my CV?

Coming soon... But here's a short preview: I recently worked on the agency software-as-a-service [HQ](https://hellohq.io) and its reimagined companion [Q.](https://meetq.ai) at [HQLabs](https://hqlabs.com/).

I'm pretty comfortable in both front- and backend, and I dabble in (dev) ops from time to time. I'm a sucker for clean and maintainable code (after all, I prefer to code for fun rather than profit...)

#### # Any questions? Wanna say hello?

I am a bit shy, but you can send me an [email](mailto:www.marktiedemann@gmail.com), or just DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkTiedemannDE).

#### # Found a typo or, _worse_, a bug?

Please let me know! The [source](https://github.com/marktiedemann/marktiedemann.github.io) of this site is available on GitHub, too. Issues, feedback, and PRs are welcome!
